 1.1 Overview
 The Campus360 Solution is a web-based system designed to improve various aspects of uni
versity life by offering multiple features. It includes a cafeteria management system where
 students and faculty can pre-order meals, check estimated serving times, and order using table
specific QR codes. The bus seat management feature helps students check available seats,
 manage bus occupancy, and use polls to schedule shuttle services effectively. For clubs, it pro
vides dedicated pages to showcase events, allow registrations, and enable members to manage
 activities. Additionally, the system includes a communication hub where students and alumni
 can share research and project details, keeping collaboration and experience-sharing within the
 university community.
 1.2 Problem Domain
 Universities often face many challenges in managing day-to-day services and activities. The
 faced problem are given below:
 The major issue occurs in the cafeteria, where students and faculty cannot always get their
 desired meals due to limited stock or for long waiting in queues. There is no system to pre
order meals, which leads to uncertainty about meal availability. Additionally, students often
 have to wait without knowing the estimated time to receive their orders, causing trouble.
 The transport system is another area with many problems. Students sometimes cannot find
 available seats on university buses because there is no way to check seat availability online.
 Different class schedules mean students finish at different times, making it difficult to manage
 bus schedules efficiently, especially when buses return from the university. The number of
 students varies across time slots, and staff often struggle to decide how many buses are needed
 due to a lack of real-time information.
 Many universities do not have a dedicated page for clubs to manage their events. Students
 miss out on important information about ongoing and upcoming activities, and club members
 or moderators have no platform to manage or update event details easily.
 Another gap is the absence of a communication platform for students and alumni. Cur

rent students cannot share their research or project achievements, and alumni have no way to
 f
 ind students for assistance with part-time or full-time opportunities. This creates a missed
 opportunity for professional networking and collaboration within the university community.
 1.3 Motivation
 The Campus360 Solution aims to improve campus life by solving common problems faced by
 students, faculty, and staff. The key reasons for developing this system are:
 • Improving Cafeteria Management:
 The cafeteria often faces problems like no more meals or waiting in long lines for meals,
 especially during busy hours. With the pre-order system, students and faculty can reserve
 meals early, making sure they get the food they want without waiting. The system also
 shows the estimated time to get the meal, making it easier for users to plan.
 • Improving the Transport System:
 There is no bus system to allow students to check seat availability. This causes confusion
 is any bus has an available seat or not. The new system lets students see which buses have
 emptyseats. Apolling system will also help bus staff understand how many students need
 the bus at different times, making planning easier.
 • Managing Club Activities:
 Many universities don’t have a clear system for managing club events. This makes it
 harder for students to join or keep track of events. With the new system, clubs will have
 a dedicated page to show upcoming events and allow students to register easily. Club
 members and moderators can also update event details. Moderators can create weekly or
 monthly context on this page.
 • Making Communication Easier:
 Students and alumni often miss opportunities to work together on research or projects
 because there’s no easy way to connect. The communication hub in Campus360 will
 allow students and alumni to create profiles, share their work, and offer or ask for help on
 projects. This will help students gain valuable experience while giving alumni a chance
 to find help for their projects or jobs.

 Literature Review
 The Campus360 Solution project aims to build a single web-based system to make campus
 life easier for students, teachers and staff. This system integrates key features such as cafeteria
 pre-ordering, club activity management, bus seat reservation, communication hubs, and student
 and teacher portals.
 Many universities provide only basic online services like academic portals and notices.
 However, they don’t have integrated platforms for managing important non-academic activities
 that are essential for students’ daily campus life. Without features like meal management,
 transportation systems, and club activity pages, students face problems and fewer opportunities
 to stay engaged.
 Green University of Bangladesh focuses on academic details and faculty information but
 lacks features for managing extracurricular activities, cafeteria pre-ordering, or transportation
 systems [1]. Similarly, the University of Scholars and Primeasia University offer student por
tals and academic information but do not include cafeteria management, real-time transporta
tion features, or a system for organizing club events [2] [3]. The State University of Bangladesh
 provides faculty portal and academic notices but does not address the need for managing bus
 seat availability or club events [4]. Similarly, Southeast University provides various academic
 resources, yet it lacks tools for efficient meal pre-ordering, club activity tracking, or communi
cation hubs to connect students and alumni [5]
